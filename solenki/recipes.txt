Mix ingredients into a dough. Put into the fridge for 2-3 hours. 
Take the dough out of the fridge and cut into 8 equal pieces. Spread each piece into a thin circle (0.5 cm tick, 25 cm in diameter), cut into 16 pieces and roll each one like a small croissant. 
Put each piece onto a trail covered with baking paper and sprinkle with sesame seeds or salt crystals. 
Bake 15-20 minutes in a pre-heated oven at 200 C.
