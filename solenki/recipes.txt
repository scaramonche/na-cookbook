Mix ingredients into a dough. Put into the fridge for 2-3 hours. 
Take the dough out of the fridge and cut into 8 equal pieces. Spread each piece into a thin circle (0.5 cm tick), cut into 16 pieces and roll each one like a small croissant. 
Put onto a trail with baking paper and bake 15-20 minutes in a pre-heated oven at 200 C.
